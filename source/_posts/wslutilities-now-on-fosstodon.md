After some thought, especially the mess around Twitter recently, I decided to move to mastodon as the main platform, or more specifically, [FOSStodon](https://fosstodon.org).

You can find us here: <https://fosstodon.org/@wslutilities> or search <@wslutilities@fosstodon.org>

### But... what about the tweets?

Don't worry! I have already set up to sync the mastodon account to the Twitter account, and I will still interact on Twitter. Right now, I am not abandoning Twitter, I just use less Twitter now.

### You are posting a lot about everything else but `wslu`...

I am REALLY sorry about it. I recently got a new job which got me really busy. This is some soon™ moment  ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯ but I will be speed up and get you the update really soon.
