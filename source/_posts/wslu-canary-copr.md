After several tests, as part of the CI/CD package deployment experiments, wslu Canary Build is now available for COPR!

you can install canary builds using the following commnads:

```
sudo dnf copr enable wslutilities/wslu-canary
sudo dnf install wslu
```

Since it is a development build version, there will definitely be bugs. Please don't hesitate to report to <https://github.com/wslutilities/wslu/issues>.
