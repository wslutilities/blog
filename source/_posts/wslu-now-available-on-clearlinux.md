A few month later, I finally is able to fullfill [the request for adding Clear Linux](https://github.com/wslutilities/wslu/issues/124#issuecomment-1206740072): You can now finally install wslu from Clear Linux!

You can install using the following command:

```
sudo swupd 3rd-party add wslutilities https://pkg.wslutiliti.es/clearlinux
sudo swupd 3rd-party bundle-add wslu
```

Please don't hesitate to report to <https://github.com/wslutilities/wslu/issues> if you encounter any issues.
